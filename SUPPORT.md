# 🙏 Getting support for ESPHome Ferraris Meter
Have a question or need help? No problem! But rather than opening an issue, please ask away on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/jensrossbach/esphome-ferraris-meter/discussions/categories/q-a) in the **Q&A** category. I will try to answer your question as soon as possible.

If you are already familiar with the software, don't hesitate to support others by answering their questions.
